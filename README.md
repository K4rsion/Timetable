---

### Overview
This project is a timetabling application. It helps the user to produce a timetable within the
following constraints:
- the room set and room types (lecture room, computer room, laboratory, etc.);
- groups of students;
- subjects, groups and tutors;
- general policies (lunch break, maximum duration of studies per day, etc).
The application provides functionality to automatically build a timetable given a set of constraints, such
as above.
